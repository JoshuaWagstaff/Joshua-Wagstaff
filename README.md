I am a cybersecurity professional with a Bachelor's in Information Technology Management and certifications in CompTIA Network+, CompTIA Security+, CompTIA CySA+, and ISC2 Certified in Cybersecurity. I specialize in SOC analysis, network defense, and incident response. My hands-on experience with tools like Wireshark, Splunk, Snort, and ELK Stack allows me to develop practical skills for addressing real-world security challenges. I am actively enhancing my expertise in penetration testing, endpoint security, and digital forensics, with a focus on network traffic analysis and incident response. I’m eager to apply my skills in a professional setting and contribute to safeguarding critical infrastructure.

## Objective

As an aspiring cybersecurity professional, I am seeking a Tier 1 Analyst role within a Security Operations Center (SOC). With certifications in CompTIA Security+, CySA+, Network+, and ISC2 Certified in Cybersecurity, I am prepared to bring my expertise in incident response, network defense, and security monitoring to help organizations mitigate cyber threats. I am committed to continuous learning and growth while contributing to a team focused on protecting infrastructure from evolving cyber risks.
